After clicking one of those buttons, authenticate with GitHub or GitLab and choose a repository name. Netlify then automatically creates a clone of the repository in your GitHub or GitLab account. Next, it builds and deploys the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard after completing the build.

**Note for Bitbucket users:** Netlify CMS supports Bitbucket repositories, but Bitbucket's permissions won't work with the Deploy to Netlify buttons above. You can still set up a repository manually, or follow the [tutorial](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site) for adding Netlify CMS to an existing site.
